# ðŸ§¬ OriginScale Clustering Algorithm

## Overview

**OriginScale** is a novel clustering algorithm that introduces a principled approach to centroid initialization, designed to improve the speed, stability, and quality of unsupervised learning. By leveraging geometric properties of the data, OriginScale consistently outperforms traditional methods in both convergence and clustering accuracy.

## Key Features

- **Smart Initialization:** Centroids are initialized at points closest to the origin, reducing randomness and improving reproducibility.
- **Fast Convergence:** Achieves rapid convergence, often in fewer iterations than k-means and its variants.
- **Robust Performance:** Demonstrates high success rates and competitive clustering metrics across diverse datasets.
- **Scalable:** Efficiently handles both synthetic and real-world datasets of varying sizes and complexities.
- **Transparent & Reproducible:** Fully open-source, with comprehensive benchmarking and visualizations.

## Algorithm Description

1. **Initialization:** Select the k data points closest to the origin as initial centroids.
2. **Assignment:** Assign each data point to the nearest centroid using Euclidean distance.
3. **Update:** Recompute centroids as the mean of assigned points.
4. **Convergence:** Repeat assignment and update steps until centroids stabilize or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

## Pseudocode

```python
def originscale(X, k, max_iter=300):
    # Step 1: Initialization
    centroids = select_k_closest_to_origin(X, k)
    for i in range(max_iter):
        # Step 2: Assignment
        labels = assign_points_to_centroids(X, centroids)
        # Step 3: Update
        new_centroids = compute_means(X, labels, k)
        # Step 4: Convergence check
        if np.allclose(centroids, new_centroids):
            break
        centroids = new_centroids
    return labels, centroids
```
